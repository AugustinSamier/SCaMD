We would like to derive a list of short sentences from long and convoluted sentences. For each long sentence, you will use punctuation (e.g., comma, semicolon, etc.), coordinating conjunctions (e.g., for, and, etc.), subordinating conjunctions (e.g., although, because) etc. to divide the sentence into multiple short sentences, which are easy to understand.
Ensure that each of the short sentences reflects a part of the larger sentence.
Here are some examples.
